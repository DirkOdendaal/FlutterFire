# FlutterFire

This Project has become alot more than I anticipated. Its growing quite nicely.

I am in the process of teaching myself the proper workflow of flutter as well as Firebase and all its components.

Feel free to fork this repo. Rememeber to Copy your own firebase Config File from your own firebasae project to see the results of Storage and Database calls.

Also if you have Firebase project not in the euw then remove the link in the references in the firebase_api.dart file.

Find the official docs on Flutter and Firebase here :
